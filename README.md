# Onmi-01
Our project is about an Arduino Bluetooth-controlled car, which has 2 motors for 2 wheels, which can run both forward and backward, in the back and 1 multi-directional ball in the front of the car. The main base of the car is the Arduino, which is like a part that we upload codes onto it and it will base on the codes to control the car. One other important part is a Bluetooth module HM-10 with Bluetooth 4.0 that allows iPhones to connect to the Arduino and control it through an app called BitBlue. The mechanism of the car is quite simple. The app will provide you 4 arrows to control 4 directions of the car and some other buttons for other functions depending on the users. When we press forward, the app will understand that we press “F” and send a signal to the Arduino. We wrote a code that when the Arduino receive a signal “F”, both wheels will run and the car will go forward. We did the same to backward arrow with a signal “B”, both wheels will run backward. When we press left and right, the Arduino will receive a “L” signal and a “R” signal, respectively. In this situation, one of 2 wheels will stop while the other one will run. This make the car turn left and right. We also provide the users with a brake button that when pressed, 2 motors will stop.
